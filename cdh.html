<p><b>Reviews and Blurbs</b></p>

<p>"<i>Critical Digital Humanities</i> is a well-researched, well-written, timely text and a vibrant articulation of the connections that exist between literary theory and the methods of the digital humanities."<br>
--<i>American Literary History</i></p>


<p> "Dobson provides a thought-provoking overview of critical views on digital humanities. He points repeatedly and with vigor at crucial aspects to consider when doing digital humanities in the tradition of literary criticism."<br>
--<i>Journal of Literary Theory</i></p>

<p>"<i>Critical Digital Humanities</i> is an important corrective to approaches that frame computational data as inviolable, unbiased, and essentially trustworthy. Dobson masterfully combines cultural theory with complex computational approaches and points to areas for further development by digital humanists looking to resist the slide toward scientism, remembering that they are, after all, humanists."<br>
--<i>Journal of Folklore Research</i></p>

<br><br><b>About <i>Critical Digital Humanities:</i></b><br>

<p>I was delighted to have my book appear in the formative and
field-influential "Topics in the Digital Humanities" series at University of
Illinois Press edited by Susan Schreibman. It was published in 2019 and
followed key texts on digital methods (Matthew L. Jockers's <a
href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p079078"><i>Macroanalysis:
Digital Methods and Literary History</i></a> (2013) and Stephen Ramsay's
<a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p078200"><i>Reading
Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism</i></a> (2011), both of which were
subjects of critique in my book). In the 2010s there were few publishers
interested in digital humanities work and this series was incredibly important
to the growth of the field.</p>

<p>I wrote <i>CDH</i> to serve as both a meta-critical account of emergent
methods in digital humanities (or really much more like what we are now calling
computational literary studies, as a few reviewers have pointed out) and a walk
through the "stack" of methods that might be used in a graduate or
undergraduate course on the digital humanities. I organized the book as a
traversal through typical workflows used in DH. I used my <a
href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1084805.1084813">prior experience</a> with
designing, executing, and analyzing workflows for computational science in
support of high-performance and grid computing as a way to ground the methods
and choices made by investigators and researchers in the humanities. Once thes
choices and transformations were articulated, I thought some of the book's
major arguments would become apparent. Workflows are a key technology for
reproducibility, a notable issue in many computational fields and one that will
become increasingly important in the present era of deep learning and
generative AI.</p>

<img src="images/cdh-workflow.png" width="400px" align="center">

<p>I created a series of workflows with <a
href="https://graphviz.org/">GraphViz's</a> dot language but the publisher
preferred to re-create these drawings. The above image appears as "Figure 1.1" in
the book. It describes a generic workflow for almost any computational activity
that one would do with texts. I was slightly interested in the difference
between the so-called born-digital digital and the digitized text, especially
as I was trained as a nineteenth-century Americanist and worked with a variety
of editions and representations of texts.</p>

<p>I wanted each chapter to move through problems highlighted by these workflow visualizations.
The chapters move from thinking about layers of transformations to critical
analysis (via my historicization of an algorithm) of a specific choice made at one layer:
"Protocols, Methods, and Workflows: Digital Ways of Reading," "Can an Algorithm Be Disturbed? Machine Learning," 
"Intrinsic Criticism, and the Digital Humanities," "Digital Historicism and the Historicity of Digital Texts," and 
"The Cultural Significance of k-NN."</p>
